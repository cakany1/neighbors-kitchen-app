    "questions_title": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)",
    "q0": "Why is there no app in the App Store?",
    "a0": "Neighbors Kitchen is a Progressive Web App (PWA). This means you install it directly from your browser to your home screen – no App Store needed. This way, we avoid the high store fees (15-30%), can deliver updates instantly, and you don't need storage space for another app. The PWA works just like a native app: with push notifications, offline capability, and fast access.",
    "q1": "Why do I need to enter my partner's details?",
    "a1": "For couple registrations, we require photos and names of both partners for safety reasons: Chefs should know who might be at their door. For 'Ladies Only' offers, the female partner must pick up the meal – the system automatically reminds you. This creates transparency and trust in our community.",
    "q2": "How does payment work?",
    "a2": "Registration is free. You only pay if the chef has selected the \"Online Payment (Apple Pay / Card)\" option. Payment is then made digitally during reservation.",
    "q3": "Is this a restaurant?",
    "a3": "No! Here, private neighbors cook for neighbors. It's about community and preventing food waste, not commercial sales.",
    "q4": "Do I have to meet the chef?",
    "a4": "Yes, the handover usually takes place in person. With \"Ghost Mode\", anonymous pickup is also possible, for example at the house entrance, mailbox, or at a nearby tram stop.",
    "q5": "What is 'Ladies Only' mode?",
    "a5": "Women can set their offers to be visible only to other women. This increases safety and creates a protected space for female users.",
    "q6": "What happens if I don't show up?",
    "a6": "That's unfair! Anyone who doesn't show up receives a bad rating. This can lead to immediate Karma deductions and, in the worst case, suspension. You can cancel bookings for free within 15 minutes.",
    "q7": "Can I also barter?",
    "a7": "Yes! Many chefs accept barter (e.g., dessert for main course or a bottle of wine). After the meal, you can choose whether to send money or bring something.",
    "q8": "Is the food safe?",
    "a8": "We rely on trust & community reviews. Pay attention to Karma points and positive reviews from other users.",
    "q9": "How do I become a chef?",
    "a9": "Anyone can immediately offer meals once the profile photo is uploaded (mandatory). If you additionally want to receive the ✓ Verified badge, click \"Get Verified\" in the profile (optional ID upload).",
    "q10": "What does the platform cost?",
    "a10": "Using the app is free. For digital transactions, a fixed service fee of CHF 2.00 is charged to operate and further develop the platform.",
    "q11": "Where can I see the exact location?",
    "a11": "To protect privacy, you only see the exact address after booking confirmation by the chef. Before that, only the approximate neighborhood is displayed.",

    "org_a1": "No. Neighbors Kitchen is a facilitation platform. Meals are shared privately. Voluntary contributions are solely to cover ingredients or energy costs.",

    "org_a2": "Municipalities can support Neighbors Kitchen ideologically or organizationally (e.g., introduction at the neighborhood level). The community remains self-organized – institutions act as enablers, not controllers.",
